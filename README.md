Clustering Project
Name: Atishay Jain

## Overview

This repository contains two open-ended projects aimed at clustering data:

### Project 1: OpenReview Website Analysis

An open-ended project intended to provide clusters in a visual representation based on types of Subjects observed from the provided OpenReview website and two CSV files based upon the website.

### Project 2: Code Review Clustering

OpenStack has been used for code review for many repositories. Allocating the code review tasks to code reviewers is time-consuming and requires significant expertise. It is important to categorize the type of code check-ins. Please take a look at [OpenDev Code Review](https://review.opendev.org/), export a list of more than 500 check-ins, clustering each row/sample based on their architectural attributes, e.g., documentation related, performance improvement, test coverage, or improve testability, security enhancement, etc.

## Prerequisites
